# Wildlife Educational Website: :raised_hands:

This Project depicts basic work on Html and Css. While going through a random assignment on search engine, I worked on this assignment to touch the basic of html and Css.

# Project Description: :open_hands:

The Project have two files, one for html & other for css. Created a multimedia website  and used resource about my chosen species from open web archives.

The Background is set with an image and this image runs through all of the other pages connected to each of the bottons. Used various HTML5 semantic elements such as meta, title, hyperlinks. Basic elements such as for pagagraph <p>, headings<h> and others are used to develop the project. 

Various media resources such as Background audio, video links are added to help reader educate about the topic as well.

# Difficulties tackled: :writing_hand:

It was an beginner project with least possible difficulties. Most time was spent on the layout of the project and recollecting a few tags for the pages.

Hope you liked the project.
